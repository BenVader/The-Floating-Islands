<h1>THE FLOATING ISLES CHAPTER SYNOPSIS</h1>

<h2>Prologue</h2>

<p>Our story is set in the world of The Floating Isles, where mysterious forces have raised up the land, and hold it suspended in the air. From small archipelagos of little more than rocks and boulders, to majestic continental shelves; these lands hang at different heights above the world ocean, that broils deep below with storms and mist.</p>

<p>These Floating Isles for the most part move glacially slowly, in an intricate dance that when measured at the human level can be barely perceptible, punctuated only by a few rogue islands that soar across the sky to their own inscrutable beat. Legends speak of a cycle of periodical chaos, where the sedate steps are interrupted by unpredictable upheaval, when even the largest and most populated continents are not safe from quakes and collisions. The periods are called by some the time of the Churn.</p>

<p>Life on these Floating Isles is forced to adapt or perish. Even specials that can learn to thrive in the often-vertical environments, can then be cut off from their territories and thrown into an unintended migration when the Churn comes. Flying and climbing species are moribund, and plant life has too adapted in its own ways to the chaotic environment. Some few species, however, have gained the ability to harness whatever physics defying force keeps up the land, and can instinctively manipulate this magic in many incredible ways. Creatures with this power are known to exhibit crystalline growths that pierce their hide or scales and seem to act as a focus for this magical energy.</p>

<p>The effects of the Churn can be clearly seen in the human populations of the Floating Isles. Many human empires have risen to great cultural and technological heights, only to be torn apart and fall when the Churn comes. Cut off and isolated populations have diverged evolutionarily, giving rise to the modern races: short and stocky dwarves, lithe and nimble elves, elusive halflings and gnomes, now all share the world with common men and women, building their societies on the ruins of those who have come before.</p>

<p>In modern times, within the northern temperate zone, there are a collection of lands and kingdoms where the races have achieved a measure of tolerance and harmony. An ancient organization known as the Ropers Guild have constructed a large network of stairways and bridges between many Isles, bringing many peoples into contact and allowing trade to flow.</p>

<p>With this trade has come not only prosperity, but also the exchange of knowledge, as great centers of learning have grown in several places. Recent advances in dirigible airships have allowed the Northern Kingdoms to expand their influence further, venturing out into the world in search of resources and treasure. Others have begun to experiment with technology derived from the magic focusing crystals taken from killed or captured beasts, and a controversial industry of hex-tech has begun to gain in provenance and in infamy. For the development of hex-tech is a dangerous endeavor, often leading to unpredictable disaster as forces are unleashed outside of an artificers&rsquo; control.</p>

<p>Our adventure truly begins on the Isle of Albony. Though not as large or powerful a kingdom as some of its neighbors, Albony is a well-connected way stop on many or the busiest trade routes in the Northern Kingdoms, and a relatively rich land due to its many vineyards and the rope vine plantations on the</p>

<p>southern face. Here, as in many places, the call has gone out for adventurers, as tales have reached even peaceful Albony, that not all is right, and strife has found the Northern Kingdoms&hellip;..</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Chapter 1 &ndash; A Wind Rises</h2>

<p>And so, finally, we begin&hellip;.</p>

<p>As the eyes of the gods looks down upon a world shrouded in mists. From the roiling core ocean below, to the highest lands above, as they move together in the steps of the great dance.</p>

<p>Some of the gods slumber still, though some have prepared long for the coming days, as the dance begins its crescendo.</p>

<p>The eye is drawn north to a point around which it seems the whole dance has begun to coalesce.</p>

<p>As we watch, a wind rises around the peak to Cragghorn, piercing into the sunlight high above the world below. It rushes down the slopes of the mountains ever crowned in snow, and out across the great tundra across craig known as the Urg.</p>

<p>Here it swirls through the orcish ruins of what was once a great tribe, now lost to history in the turning of the dance.</p>

<p>To the edge of the planes the wind blows, then the down it plunges through the icey clouds as it descends the height of Cragg, the world head. It eddies and whirls around the isles that cluster at Craggs feet, gaining speed as it is sucked under a great edge and whistling between the hanging towers of overhang. Here is the songs of the dwarfs around their forges are momentarily drowned out by the winds fringed path.</p>

<p>Down the road from Overhang, beneath the snow line, the wind still blew, past Dunduggen and on into the forests of albony. Almost spent now, the wind whips up the mists to the susurration or branches either side of the Mule Road.</p>

<p>The mist parts and we see two figures, one small the other tall&hellip;.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Chapter 2 &ndash; A Night of Blood and Fire</h2>

<p>Welcome back to these floating isles.</p>

<p>As we look down through the mists upon several destinies that have begun to entwine.</p>

<p>Two travellers from different lands were approaching a crossroads, when they were waylaid by a wolf. This near to a town like this you would never expect this, but through the mists you could sense a presence driving this beast to its rage.</p>

<p>Between you, you managed to defeat the beast, but not without taking an injury, and so you made your way into town in search of medical aid</p>

<p>Meanwhile in town in the hopes end Inn, we watched as two most unlikely allies met after a scuffle in an inn, where we starting to glean that perhaps this idyllic seeming town was had some hidden, darker currents beneath the surface.</p>

<p>That evening as you two had finally found the doctor you sought deep in his cups; disaster struck.</p>

<p>The town was invaded by the pack of wolves you glimpsed upon the road, but these were not just normal beasts, for they were able to harness the arcane and fling magic attacks about the town.</p>

<p>Luckily, once you had joined forces, you were able to defeat these eldritch invaders, with the help of a mysterious teifling, but not without collateral damage.</p>

<p>And here we find you all, amongst the bodies of wolves and townsfolk, lit by the dying fires alight along the path of these not-wolves.</p>

<p>You have already briefly spoken to the guards, who have warned you not to leave town before the town meeting tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>Now as the sun has set and its light fades from the mists leaving only the glow of lanterns and fires.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Chapter 3 &ndash; A Hitch in Destiny</h2>

<p>Destinies begin to entwine in the town of Crossways. Fresh from battle with a pack of mutated magical wolves that attacked the town, our budding party of adventures lick their wounds in the Hope&rsquo;s End inn, where they come across a cantankerous and someone racist dwarf named Tordan, who helps to heal them for a price.</p>

<p>After an evening of guarded discussion, and a night&#39;s rest, the party head for the town hall to report to the meeting. Waylaid on route by a thug seeking revenge on Caefeff and Fiendall, Tordan brutally murders him, and they arrive at the town hall to meet Captain Harl Fenton, who is wrong footed at the news of the murder.</p>

<p>During the meeting after giving their witness accounts of the attack on the town, a child they saw that night beseeches the council for help, saying that her employers at Mist Fall Farm had also been attacked. The local Ropers Guild rep hires the party to investigate.</p>

<p>After shopping for supplies, they meet the roper at the town gates, who names himself Hitch. As the party prepares to step back out into the wilds....</p>

<h2>Chapter 4 &ndash; The Path to Mistfall</h2>

<p>As we return to the floating isle, six destinies begin to weave together. As our six green, if plucky adventurers head out of Crossways, striking out along the south road. Hired by an eccentric representative of the Ropers Guild named Hitch to accompany him to investigate a reported ruckus at Mistfall Farm, where the guild has significant interests in the rope vines grown there.</p>

<p>As they have journeyed through the forests south of the town, they have found that there is some truth to the rumours of monster attacks and strange occurrences.</p>

<p>They have had to fight off a cockatrice, they have been attacked by a fairy dragon as they camped the first night.</p>

<p>Then on the second day of travel, after having felt the tremors, they found a vast crack in the continent, and a new cliff split the road in two. Spotting a now uncovered cave in the cliff side, they managed to get across with a thrown halfling and a lot of rope. Once inside the cave though and the ventured inside they were fell upon by a pack of piercers.</p>

<p>Now finally, after three fights and three victories, inside the cavern, now obviously a tunnel, light still shining in through the direction they came in, amongst the worm corpses, our adventure begins again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Chapter 5 &ndash; A New Enemy Emerges</h2>

<p>As we drop through the mists we see the isle of Crossways, in the kingdom of Albony. But the isle has been sundered. Huge fissures now cross the isle with swathes of destruction. At the southern edge we see a vast chunk teetering forward, barely still attached to the rest. Here at Mistfall Farm, our new company of heroes have come, in the employ of the ropers guild, to search for the cause of the farms reported destruction, but there they have found far more than they bargained for&hellip;.</p>

<p>As the last quake struck you were descending the stair, Caeffef was saved from a fall to his death by hitch, and below you found yet more death. But before you could investigate what had happened a far greater threat was revealed as an enormous flying dinosaur set down on the farm plateau. A group of foreigners disembarked lead by a figure they called Lord Boros.</p>

<p>As you hid in the farm house, a bronze Dragon descended from above immediately killing more of Boros&rsquo; retinue and their flying mount. Boros threw up a wall of force to protect the last of his people and then proceeded to Solo the dragon. You managed to defeat two of his wasp guard in the ruins of the farmhouse, and then capture his scribe, a Kenku named Scrivens, who you interrogate for information. He spoke of the crystal throne, and a vast empire, and gave you a hint of how Boros was able to command the magic of the world.</p>

<p>And here we return to your adventure yet again surround by the dead, safe for now, but with danger still close by&hellip;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Chapter 6 &ndash; A Wild Ride</h2>

<p>Once more we return to the floating isles and our party of journeyman adventurers who are beginning to find that they may have bitten off more than they can chew.</p>

<p>Though they have triumphed in combat, their mission to save mistfall farm was a failure, finding the owner Hari dead with his wife inside its ruin. After looting the place for a small fortune and pilfering various magical weapons from the dead, members of the party attempted to join with the Vir, as the captures Scrivens had indicated was possible.</p>

<p>They fell unconscious, seeing visions of their past, and awoke changed by it, with strange new abilities they are yet to fully understand.</p>

<p>After a night in the ruins the morning returned and with it, came Lord Boros searching for his people. There was a confrontation that left Hitch grievously injured and contain serious threats to the whole of the North Kingdoms, Boros once again displayed his power, breaking mist fall farm away from the rest of the isle leaving it spinning away through the air.</p>

<p>The team worked together using the goods lift and an improvised parachute to survive the crash, as they landed on a new isle that Hitch told them was named The Warrens. Hightails it away from the crash site they were set upon by a land shark, and the team explored their new abilities to defeat it.</p>

<p>And so once again we join our party, gathered around the corpse of the bulette....</p>

<p>Its about lunch time</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Chapter 7 &ndash; Arrival at Raveen</h2>

<p>Having survived their descent through the clouds to the Warrens, our party head for civilization, and the city of Raveen. Hitch attempts to tie the group together more tightly with a sense of group identity, as he admits that he will have to leave them when they arrive in the city. And after purchasing a horse and cart to speed the journey along, they argue about what to call themselves, eventually settling on the possibly temporary and certainly ambiguous moniker of D.T.F.</p>

<p>Upon arrival they find the city thronged with crowds of sports fans, eagerly awaiting the big game tomorrow, the final for the Windjammers tournament. Hitch leaves them with a small rope token and the name of an inn; and disappears into the crowd.</p>

<p>While half the party attempt to sell on the horse and cart, Tordan spots a strange metal burrow creature watching them in the stable yard. When he points his crossbow at it, it an electrical shock which almost floors him, and burrows away.</p>

<p>Distracted from his sudden urge for revenge, Tordan joins the rest of the party as they head to the Whistling Wall, the commercial district of Raveen. They manage to get two small rooms with the help of Hitch&rsquo;s small rope token, and Seldom and Doro go up to bed.</p>

<p>Feeling the night is still young, Caefydd, Bune and Feindall leave Tordan drinking with the sports fans and head to the docks, looking for a possible way to Kingsholm. Feindall ingratiates himself with sailors from The Gladius, King Brontide&rsquo;s large regal warship that is currently docked in Raveen; and plies them with drink for information about the ship and the king himself.</p>

<p>After a shaky start, Caefydd and Bune manage to contact the local unground, setting up a meeting with a fence for their Mistfall booty at 10 am the next day in the Whistling Wall.</p>

<p>Their business done they returned to the Broken Beard Inn to sleep. And now as the rain starts to patter on the windows of the inn, and the breeze brings renewed tribal singing from the crowds, we rejoin the DTF crew, on finals day....</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Chapter 8 &ndash; A Fence and More Fights</h2>

<p>We return to the DTF crew between the rocky bluffs of Raveen, a city known for its colorful ingenuity, though what our heroes have found there is more dark intrigue.</p>

<p>The city is full to bursting with tribal sports fans, who&rsquo;s revel is now thoroughly underway. Though the crew have been able to avoid any trouble with the hooligans this morning they have met their share of strife.</p>

<p>Caefydd lead the party further up to whistling wall to find, after a cryptic clue was placed in his pocket, a way down a spillway to meet a female fence named Fingers. After an awkward exchange involving Seldom and another half-orc, the business was done, and the party was just exchanging pleasantries with Fingers when they were dropped in on by a trio of macabre constructs. Half animal, half machine, and half magic, the creatures attacked them with electric shocks and bites of their metal jaws. After defeating these foes, the crew discerned that these could have something to do with the equipment thefts and missing pets reported in the city.</p>

<p>After the fight they headed back to their inn for a short rest, where Dora snuck away for a clandestine meeting of her own. She met with a shadowy figure from the order of her monastery, the order of the final dusk. He bade her to stick with the crew and steer them on towards Kingsholm as they planned to, while keeping them from making too much of a crisis in Raveen.</p>

<p>This meeting done and the party rested up, they headed out once more, with a couple of hours to spend before the start of the Windjammers final. Torden strode off into the crowd in search strong drink and the hooligans he had met the night before, and the rest of the party went shopping in the whistling wall.</p>

<p>In Arnie&rsquo;s Arms Amporium though once again the party where set upon. This time by animated armor and flying swords. And it&#39;s here, amongst the broken and burned debris of that fight we join them again&hellip;.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9 &ndash; The Windjammers Final</h2>

<p>Once more we see the DTF crew catch their breath after another battle. This time on a shopping trip at the Whistling Wall in Raveen, and without the party&rsquo;s cleric, they were set upon but two animated suits of Armour and two flying swords.</p>

<p>Fresh from the fight they calmed the proprietor of the store; and set about investigating. They found small devices of metal, vir and animal parts attached to some of the objects that attacked them. Arnie (the shopkeeper), initially suspicious, had little information, other than grumbles about a dark-skinned gnome with a crested helmet who had been poking around the shop earlier. Caefedd convinced Arnie to give them his Mark, so that they could add his weight to their story when the crew later head to the Artificers Guild to continue their adventure.</p>

<p>With that, and their shopping done, the team headed back to the forked beard to pick up Tordan and a short rest, to have a few drinks before they all headed out towards the arena for the Windjammers final.</p>

<p>Picking up some merchandise on the way, the team arrived at the arena where they met Hugo Van Poorfleet, a Dwarven noble from Overhang who knew Tordan&rsquo;s family. He accompanied them up to the</p>

<p>best seating in the arena, where they could rub shoulders with guild masters and even be in the presence of the King.</p>

<p>Before the start of the match Tordan convinced the group to bet the teams ill-gotten gains on the solitaire, only to be rather shocked when she came out to take her place that she was a rather small tabaxi woman, facing the much larger and more powerful Orc, the local champion the Butcher of Bothforus.</p>

<p>As the rest of the crew made various distractions around the Nobilities stand, Tordan attempted to put his finger on the scale, subtly aiding the Solitaire as her back was against the ropes. She did finally see victory with a nut-busting final move that knocked out the Butcher.</p>

<p>But as the crowd still held their breath, terror descended on the arena. As three macabre monstrosities climbed down the sheer cliffs into the area to wreak havoc. One fell upon the butcher&rsquo;s cage, that then plunged them both down into the Raveen to their death. DTF joined forces with the solitaire, who proved to be a fine warrior to defeat the other two monsters.</p>

<p>But how much of a scene have they caused, and what will the high society of Raveen think of them now, as king Brontide himself, turns his attention towards them&hellip;.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10 &ndash; New Allies and New Objectives</h2>

<p>The stadium finally grows quiet but for the moans of the injured and the retreating screams of the spectators running for the exit. DTF once more catch their breath after a fight. They must then keep their wits about them, some only just revived from unconsciousness, as the treat with king Brontide and his guards.</p>

<p>His initial suspicion assuaged, he orders the clean-up of the area and the Admiralty to search for the source of the attack and the body of the Butcher. They were about to leave when news of riots is delivered, breaking out at the rumor that their local hero and celebrity is dead.</p>

<p>The Solitaire, introduced as Tabatha kit of Mawl, joins the crew, as brontide leads them out the back way as they wait for the riots to move away and allow them to get back to the safety of the palace. Bune collapses and they are forced to carry him on the carts the artificers are using to carry the corpses of the clockwork horrors.</p>

<p>Once within the walls of the palace, DTF has a moment to discuss what has happened to them and try to come up with a plan for talking to Brontide. Bune awakes from a strange dream and inadvertently reads the thoughts of those around him, shocking the group with the momentary appearance of a glowing vir eye in the middle of his forehead.</p>

<p>The crew are then interviewed by the head of the shield guild Duhan Vilders, and though he puts on a suspicious front, it does turn out that their valor in battle has won him over. He takes them to a state room for the night, where once the rest of the party are asleep, Dora crushes up one of the black Vir she took from their attackers and mixes it into her ink, before painting her hands and forearms with script as she was instructed but her Final Dusk contact. When the party wakes, Dora is disappointed she has seen no visions, as her friends spoke of, but when she looks at her hands and wrists, now she finds that she cannot rub the script off. More intriguingly she suspects that the different languages she painted on have moved places on her fingers, though they seem still for now.</p>

<p>As dawn breaks DTF look out through the palace windows on a city wracked damage and dotted with fires still burning. They head to the king's situation room, invited by Wilders, where they take part in the crises meeting. Some information is shared, then the party ask to speak to the king in private. For the first time they share the truth about what they have gone through, and the new threat that the northern kingdoms now face from the Shining Empire. The evidence they present and Feindal&rsquo;s commanding presence win Brontide over.</p>

<p>When the court returns to the situation room Brontide agrees a deal with DTF. He will hire them as investigators to aid the Shield Guild already struggling to merely keep the peace. If they can find the terrorist plaguing his city, Brontide will take them to Kingsholm and convene the moot.</p>

<p>Now, with the mark of the Shield Guild lending them authority in the city, DTF begin their investigation at the Artificer's guild-house</p>
